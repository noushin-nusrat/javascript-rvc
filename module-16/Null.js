//WHAT IS NULL???
//EXPLANTION ==============>>>>>>

In JavaScript, null is a special value that represents an empty or unknown value. For example, let number = null; The code above suggests that the number variable is empty at the moment and may have a value later.

let number = null;
// console.log(number);

In JavaScript, null is a primitive value that represents the absence of any object value. It is often used to indicate that a variable does not currently point to any object or has no value assigned to it.

Here are some key points about null in JavaScript:

null is a primitive value, not an object.
It is often used to initialize variables that are expected to later hold an object value.
It is loosely equal to undefined, but they are not the same; undefined typically means a variable has been declared but not assigned any value, while null is explicitly assigned to represent no value.
When you use the typeof operator with null, it returns "object", which is a historical quirk and not technically accurate.
You can explicitly assign null to variables or properties to represent the absence of a value.
Here's an example demonstrating the use of null in JavaScript:
let someVar = null;

console.log(someVar);  // Output: null
console.log(typeof someVar);  // Output: object (This is a historical quirk)

let anotherVar; // not assigned any value
console.log(anotherVar);  // Output: undefined
console.log(typeof anotherVar);  // Output: undefined


It's important to note that when working with null, you should always check for it explicitly, especially when dealing with object properties or variables that may or may not have been initialized. This can help avoid unexpected errors in your code.
